  How it works

Customers register for the service at authorised agents - often small mobile phone stores or other retailers such as barbers, butchers, bakers, etc. - and then deposit cash in exchange for electronic money. Customers can then send money to their family or friends throughout the country.

Once they have registered, all transactions are completed securely by entering a PIN number and both parties receive an SMS confirming the amount that has been transferred. The recipient receives the electronic money in real-time and then redeems it for cash by visiting another agent. Alternatively, they can spend it at an M-PESA merchant.
