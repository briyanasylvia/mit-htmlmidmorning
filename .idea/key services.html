  Case studies & customer stories
International remittances

International remittances contribute to achieving 12 of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In particular it is proven a 10% increase in per capita remittances leads to a 3.5% reduction in poverty (United Nations, 2020).

Through strong relationships with leading money transfer operators such as Western Union, MoneyGram, World Remit, Remitly and MFS Africa, M-PESA is the destination for over US$1.5 billion remittances every year, including 60% of formal remittances into Kenya and 20% into Tanzania.
Credit: M-Shwari Kenya

Launched in 2012, M-Shwari is the revolutionary service provided in partnership with Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) in Kenya, which enables M-PESA customers to instantly access loans and contribute to savings directly from their phone. For many customers using M-Shwari this was the first time they accessed formal credit or benefitted from interest earning deposits. The success of M-Shwari relies on:

    customer data: using telcom and M-PESA usage to help determine the customer’s credit risk and affordability to approve loans;
    security: customers value being able to make financial decisions confidentially, provided through transacting securely over their mobile phone; and
    flexibility: enabling customers to use savings to leverage credit and earn interest from depositing from as little as 1 Kenyan shilling.

Since launching M-Shwari in Kenya, M-PESA has launched similar services with other partner banks in Kenya and Tanzania. Over the past year, M-PESA customers have accessed over €1 billion of credit across our lending services. M-PESA Africa continues to innovate in this area, looking to support consumer choice and working hard to educate customers on the implications of access to credit.
Savings: M-Koba Tanzania

M-Koba is a service enabling customers to safely store and manage funds within a group. M-Koba was launched in Tanzania in partnership with Post Bank. Across Africa, it is very common for customers to form groups as a mechanism for helping to save and access funds. The ways these groups work vary, but they often provide extra motivation and rigour to put funds away, and by collecting across multiple people they can provide support in accumulating lump sums.

While this approach has been very successful, groups still face many challenges - which digitisation with the use of M-Koba can address. For example, M-Koba provides:

    better security: funds can only be accessed by multiple approvals with their unique M-PESA PIN;
    more transparency: customers are notified real-time when any group transaction occurs; better flexibility, in case customers cannot make a meeting in person; and
    greater efficiency: automatically keeping a trail of records and data, which is then easier to use in making decisions, for example to lend to a member.

Business collections: M-KOPA Solar, Kenya

In Kenya and Tanzania, M-KOPA Solar has connected hundreds of thousands of off-grid homes to affordable solar powered electricity for lighting, cooking and charging their mobile phones. Since the initial outlay for the solar kit is unaffordable for most households, through M-PESA customers make small daily payments to M-KOPA, paying off the cost of the kit over the course of a year. The solar system is then fully owned by the household who can continue to use it without making any further payments.

"M-KOPA has brought the benefits of solar lighting to thousands of rural homes, enabling our children to study, relieving our mothers from the burden of fetching firewood and burning kerosene late into the night”- President Kenyatta, July 2015
NGO disbursements: World Food Programme, Kenya

The World Food Programme (WFP) was keen to stimulate the local economy around the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps and reduce dependence on expensive logistics to distribute food aid flown in from abroad. To ensure the food aid vouchers they were providing to over half a million people in 125,000 households were being spent as intended on food and water, the WFP used the M-Pesa closed loop system which limited to the spending of aid to specified merchant points.

Our partnership with WFP has actively improved the livelihoods and financial independence of over half a million refugees and the local merchants living in the Dadaab and Kakuma camps.
Business disbursements: G4S Salary Payments, DRC

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), G4S struggled to pay its security staff who were spread around the country. Local supervisors would head to remote areas to pay staff with cash face-to-face, which was a huge security risk to them and their employees. M-PESA allowed G4S to pay its staff in bulk, directly to their mobile phones in an instant.
Merchant payments: Vivo Shell, Kenya

In Kenya, M-PESA tills were set up across Vivo Shell fuel stations, enabling customers to buy fuel via mobile money. At the end of the day, the fuel station supervisor could transfer the money the M-PESA till to a designated bank account via their mobile phone or a web portal. This greatly reduced cash held at the fuel station and time taken to deposit cash at the bank, increasing the security and efficiency of the fuel stations.
M-Pesa online

Pay by M-PESA is a service that allows global and domestic merchants to offer Africa’s leading payment method as a payment option at online checkouts. Through M-PESA, merchants can access over 40 million customers, the majority of whom do not have access to other online payment methods such credit or debit cards.
